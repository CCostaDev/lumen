# Lumen

Lumen is a personal dev-helper Discord bot written in TypeScript.  
Designed as the archivist of the **Off The Grid** server, Lumen helps track ideas, tasks, and project notes.

This repository is currently in early development.  
Features coming soon:

- Slash commands
- Second Brain system (`/brain add`, `/brain list`, `/brain random`, etc.)
- Web dashboard integration
